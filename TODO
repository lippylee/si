* Some bits of info that other scripts showed are not in yet. Add them.
	- Power (need logs of MacBooks and Mac Pro's with a UPS attached)
	- Temperature (need external app and code to match it)
* Fix code so it runs on other IRC clients without a change. (Maybe!)
* Add structure and website for the script, else the updater won't work for future versions.
