si - A System Information Script for the Textual IRC Client.
Coded by Marcos Alves (xeon3d@emupt.com)
Ideas and some code from KSysInfo by KanadaKid


2 Step Installation:

1) Open up Finder.
2) Copy si.scpt to your ~/Library/Application Support/Textual IRC/Scripts/ Folder.

Important Notes:

It can't do much yet.
The script is tested only against Textual 2.1 and Lion 10.7.2.
Fixes and Improvements are welcome, but be patient on me as I'm a git newbie.
